    <p>Hello, and welcome to Your Code Tutor. As the name suggests, you have found the perfect service for anyone learning to code. Here’s how the service works.</p>
    <section>
      <img class="section-header" src="img/Header What.png"/>
      <p>From traditional education, expensive bootcamps, low-cost a la carte services, to even some free resources, there are lots of options to get an education in code. However, unless you shell out the big bucks, a lot of options are missing a place to go when you need some real, live help. This is where my tutoring comes in.</p>
      <p>Tutoring, put simply, is an assist to help move you forward in your coding education. It comes in many forms. Helping with debugging, filling in knowledge gaps, study sessions, even mock interviews. I can help with all of it. All you need is the will and we will find the way together.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <img class="section-header" src="img/Header Options.png"/>
      <p>You tell me what you need, be it mentoring, instruction, or just some guidance on how to get past a wall. I can help get code working, fill in gaps in understanding, or provide a point of reference for where to go next. That being said, here is simple list of areas of study I am competent in.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Programming fundamentals, including OOP and many topics in web development (MVC, APIs, Deployment, etc.).</li>
        <li>Javascript, both client-side and Node.js. I focus on Express, React, Angular, and good ol’ Vanilla. If I get proper warning, I can probably figure out just about any framework out there enough to help.</li>
        <li>C# ASP MVC with Entity Framework. Both .Net Core and non-core.</li>
        <li>SQL and No-SQL Databases. Mostly MySQL and MongoDB but I have worked with other solutions (Redis, SQLite, etc).</li>
        <li>Mock Interviews (I work with you to determine what we need to cover).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Throughout my career I have worked with and taught other languages and frameworks. If you have been focusing your learning on anything not listed, you are always welcome <a href="mailto:rich@busyrich.com" title="Email Me" target="_blank">to ask</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="howWorks" name="howWorks">
      <img class="section-header" src="img/Header How.png"/>
      <p>Everyone receives a free 30 minute introduction. This allows both of us to get on the same page by gathering information on what you need and what I can provide. After that we can start with the tutoring.</p>
      <p>Once we are both comfortable moving forward, tutoring comes in the form of 1 hour sessions. You schedule a time with me, and when that time comes we knock out whatever we can in that hour. Pricing is based on this 1hr session model.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>$50 / Session</li>
        <li>$90 / 2 Sessions</li>
        <li>$175 / 4 Sessions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My policy will always be to support loyalty. The more sessions we have, the more likely a discount/extra time will be provided.</p>

      <img class="section-header" src="img/Header Why.png"/>
      <p>I grew up around programming, starting my learning fairly young. I also have a long and varied career to show for it. You are always welcome to check out my publicly available <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardkey/" title="My LinkedIn" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> for all my juicy career details.</p>
      <p>More than that, I care about your journey. I believe everyone can learn to code, and I absolutely love teaching and tutoring. My goal will always be to see you succeed, never to just get your money and spit out a script or manual. At the end of the day I want to see more people start their careers with confidence.</p>
